I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering at Monash University, Clayton Australia, supervised by [James Saunderson](https://ecse.monash.edu/staff/james/) and [Hamza Fawzi](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/hf323/). My research is in devising efficient convex optimization methods, such as gradient based and interior point methods, to solve problems arising in quantum information theory.

I received my B.Eng. (Honours) and B.Comm. majoring in Mechatronics Engineering and Finance, respectively, from Monash University. During this time, I worked on several projects involving optimal control and trajectory planning for robotic manipulators and driverless vehicles.

My CV can be found [here](files/cv.pdf).
